  * Fix dialog_cfabug patch: The internal_get_dlg() function locks a dialog table slot everytime it is called, but releases the lock conditionally based on the value of the function argument 'mode'. If the lock is not released in the function, it is later released outside the funct
  ion. In the patch, we have to take care also to release the slot outside the function for the mangled CallID.

  * Updated patch tm-replicate: Patched file tm.c was changed upstream a little bit so the line numbers in the patch did not fit anymore.
